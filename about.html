    <h1>My little techie story</h1>
    <p class="p">I joined Northcoders in June 2019 as I had been looking for a new challenge and a progressive career
        change. I have
        always been interested in the tech industry and I love to read and watch the latest news about it. I started
        reading
        about coding bootcamps and after an initial introduction day at Northcoders I was absolutely conviced that
        coding would
        be something that I really would like to do on a daily basis and have a career in. Previously I worked in
        finance, project management and supply chain
        roles which required adequate Microsoft Excel and problem solving skills. I completed my BSc in Business
        Administration in Hungary, and my
        MSc in Oil and Gas Finance in Aberdeen, Scotland but I have to be honest that the 2 degrees combined could not
        give me as
        much practical experience and skills as Northcoders has given me.</p>
    <p class="p">
        Previously I had no coding experience at all, even though I watched a couple of videos years ago, but to be
        honest that was all. I wish I had been able to do as much
        data manipulation as I can do now with ease. After completing the enrty challange I
        started working on my portfolio website,which I have intentionally not updated since to reflect my current level
        of knowledge firstly because it
        utilizes Bootstrap, secondly as soon as I finish the course I will build a new one in React. Throughout the
        course I was lucky enough to work with brilliant people while doing pair progpramming and enjoyed overcoming
        many challanges arising from learning new things every single day.</p>
    <p class="p">After completing 3 weeks of fundamentals I
        really enjoyed back end with all its exciting building for front end, data manipulation and the never ending
        testing. When I moved on to front end initially I was a bit doubtful that I would not enjoy it as much as I did
        back end. The beginning was very challenging but as soon as I had a better grasp of it, I began enjoying
        creating new things or
        at least something visible. By the time the third 3 week over, I felt a lot more confident working on front
        end. Currently I am in the project phase and I have been working on a Raspberry Pi project with my team members.
        We have been through some exciting and also exhausting days due to setting up our back end and Raspberry Pi
        enviromnent. It took us a couple of days to figure out things and get everything up and running with all the
        sensors and be able to feed the data to our API. Recently we have been working on front end, initially with just
        the idea of a responsive web app, but also with the intention of finishing a mobile application. </p>
